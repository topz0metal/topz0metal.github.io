                    <p class="about-me">My name is <b>John Paul Mallari Manzano</b>. I’m 31 years old. I was born on <b>June 7, 1991</b>, at Sto. Nino De San Antonio Maternity And General Hospital Dela Paz, Pasig City. I am a <b>person with a disability</b> (PWD). When my mother was giving birth to me, my father wanted a Cesarean delivery but the doctor continued the normal delivery because they thought we don’t have enough money at that time. Even though I'm a PWD, I can do other things as normal people do. I can do some house chores like cooking and washing the dishes. I’m good at drawing especially if it is nature.</p>

                    <p class="my-education">During my elementary days, in grade 1 my section is 14. But in grade 2 to grade 5 is section 1 and in grade 6 is section 4. I graduated elementary in the year 2005 at <b>Cainta Elementary School</b> (CES). After I graduated Elementary, I stopped studying for almost 5 years. Because my wheelchair got destroyed that time after my graduation and that’s the reason for my confidence and interest to study to be gone. And that’s why  I didn't even enter 1st year in High School. But that time I focused only to manage my small business (sari-sari).  In <b>2011</b>, I was able to pursue my studies through <b>Alternative Learning System</b> (ALS) and I graduated in <b>2012</b>. I stopped again for 7 years before I entered college. Now, I decided to go back again to school with the help of brothers for paying my tuition fees. Hope to achieve my dream and prove to myself that my disability does not prevent me from continuing my education.  I am presently <b>3rd year in college</b>. A <b>Bachelor in Computer Science</b> (BSCS) student in Cainta Catholic College.</p>
